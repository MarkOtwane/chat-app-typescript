✅ Assignment 1: Dynamic Task List with DOM
Objective: Learn to work with arrays and manipulate the DOM using TypeScript.
Instructions:
Create an HTML file with:
A text input field.
An "Add Task" button.
An empty <ul> or <div> to display the tasks.
In your TypeScript file:
Capture the value from the input when the button is clicked.
Push the value to an array of strings.
Update the display to show all tasks in the array (each task as a separate element).
Clear the input after adding.

✅ Assignment 2: Filter Names Starting With "J"
Objective: Practice using the filter() method and conditional rendering.
Instructions:
Use this predefined array:
const list: string[] = ["Mark", "Jone", "Joe", "Job", "Steve"];
Use the .filter() method to extract all names starting with "J".
Display the filtered list on the webpage under a heading like "Names Starting With J".

✅ Assignment 3: Find a User by Name
Objective: Use .find() to search an array of objects defined with an interface.
Instructions:
Create this user interface and sample data:
interface USer {
id: number;
name: string;
age: number;
}
const users: USer[] = [
{id: 1, name: 'Alice', age: 21},
{id: 2, name: 'Joy', age: 20},
{id: 3, name: 'Sharon', age: 19}
];
Add a text input and a "Search User" button to your HTML.
When the button is clicked:
Get the input value (user name).
Use .find() to search for a matching user by name.
Display the user's name and age if found.
If not found, display "User not found".
Expected Output (if input is "Joy"):
User Found: Joy, Age: 20
